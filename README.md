# convora
Have better group conversations


A web app for people to have better conversations as a group. Key features include:

You can create a discussion, which generates its own URL. For example, if the app's URL is convora.com and you wanted to discuss AI safety, you could create a discussion and it would create the URL, say convora.com/ai-safety.

From there, users can submit questions and people can vote on how much they agree with them. For example, someone could say, "The biggest risk of AI is through AI weapons" and each person can vote that they strongly agree, agree, are unsure, disagree, or strongly disagree. The app would show the aggregates. That way you could find which statement most people disagree with.
